# Flux In-Context workflows for ComfyUI

![Visual Identity](./assets/visual-identity.png)

A collection of ComfyUI workflows that uses the [In-Context](https://github.com/ali-vilab/In-Context-LoRA) LoRA

## How it works

Simply drag the desired `json` file from `./workflows` onto your ComfyUI web interface.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Most workflows should be using vanilla nodes, however I strongly recommend that you install [ComfyUI-Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager) to install missing nodes
